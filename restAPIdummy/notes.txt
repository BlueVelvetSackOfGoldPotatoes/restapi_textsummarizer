I never spend much time in school but I taught ladies plenty. Its true I hire my body out for pay, hey hey. Ive gotten burned over Cheryl Tiegs, blown up for Raquel Welch. But when I end up in the hay its only hay, hey hey. I might jump an open drawbridge, or Tarzan from a vine. Cause Im the unknown stuntman that makes Eastwood look so fine. Barnaby The Bears my name, never call me Jack or James, I will sing my way to fame, Barnaby the Bears my name. Birds taught me to sing, when they took me to their king, first I had to fly, in the sky so high so high, so high so high so high, so â€” if you want to sing this way, think of what youd like to say, add a tune and you will see, just how easy it can be.
